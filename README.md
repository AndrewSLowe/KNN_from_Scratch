# KNN_from_Scratch

KNN_from_Scratch contains the code for my medium article: https://medium.com/@andrewlowe_22850/k-nearest-neighbors-by-hand-a-computer-science-exercise-for-the-data-scientist-72b5821c8941

In the article, I show the reader how to build a KNNClassifier by hand. If you read the article you will learn:

    1. How a KNNClassifier model works
    2. How to perform KNNClassifier in scikit-learn
    3. How to build a KNNClassifier model by hand

Looking at the code, you can see where each code snippet from the article comes from. I have them all labeled as code snippet 1, 2, 3 ....
